# Bitloops Chatbot
The provided repository is developed by Aryan Khandelwal, who was an intern under the Ladder Internship's fall cohort of 2024. The primary purpose of this rep. is to provide all the files that were created during the making of the AI chatbot for Bitloops. The rep. consists of two main files :

1. app.py : Python file consisting the code of the chatbot
2. index.html : The UI - widget of the chatbot

To whomever reading this readme file, if you want to implement the same chatbot within your system and continue to develop it, I have provided the instructions on how I achieved this feat through this file. In case any issues arise, please feel free to contact me at aryan.fall2024@gmail.com in order to rectify any issues that persist.

# Step-by-Step Guide

**STEP 1** : __USE OpenAI's PLAYGROUND AND DEVELOP AN API KEY__

Upon developing this chatbot, it involved the usage of OpenAI's ChatGPT and it acted as the basic framework at the back-end. To import ChatGPT within your python code, you need to create an API key to have a tested ChatGPT for your personal usage. A key fact to remember is that you need to spend a minimum of $2 [Through this process, I spent $10, and realize that it was too much for its use at this state] in order to enable the incorporation of the GPT model within your code.

Please note that as this will be used for a public website where thousands of people will visit and use the chatbot, you need to adjust the amount spent accordingly on the GPT. Also, please note that this is not ChatGPT+, the instructions to do so are the following:

Go to https://platform.openai.com/chat-completions --> Upon visiting your dashboard, click the "API keys" section and create your own API key --> Upon its completion, go on to the "Usage" section and click on "Increase limit" --> Follow all the steps and proceed towards payment [For starters, I would recommend spending only $2]
