# Bitloops Chatbot
The provided repository is developed by Aryan Khandelwal, who was an intern under the Ladder Internship's fall cohort of 2024. The primary purpose of this rep. is to provide all the files that were created during the making of the AI chatbot for Bitloops. The rep. consists of two main files :

1. app.py : Python file consisting the code of the chatbot
2. index.html : The UI - widget of the chatbot

To whomever reading this readme file, if you want to implement the same chatbot within your system and continue to develop it, I have provided the instructions on how I achieved this feat through this file. In case any issues arise, please feel free to contact me at aryan.fall2024@gmail.com in order to rectify any issues that persist.
